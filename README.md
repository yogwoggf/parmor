# PArmor

PArmor is an addon that adds fun and technical combat into GMod. Currently, it's at a very work in progress stage. It's similar to the notable ACF addons but it's not intended to head the same direction. PArmor supplies the user with Wire-compatible components and weapons and expects the user to assemble any type of contraption that utilizes the weapons.

Despite the involved nature, PArmor also tries to eliminate the boring and monotonous nature of creating contraptions. Hopefully, PArmor will provide a perfect balance between complexity and fun.
